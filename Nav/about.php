        <h2>Past</h2>
        <p>Canopy was founded in 2007 by John Doe. We started off as a small company with 10 staff operating within a small 2 room complex located at North Shore. We then began to develop over time and included some of the more enhanced technology to help deal with cancer. We mainly used to help patients with breast cancer however we then in 2011 opened a new clinic in Epsom Auckland that now deals with all different types of Cancers. </p>
